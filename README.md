## I decided to use Vanilla Logic because:

1. The requirement is only one page.
2. I understood that the requirement is correct and clean work and completing the requirement completely correctly, whatever it is.
3. No restrictions were mentioned for the tools used (except for the tools that are largely not used by Eng. 'Ali Shahin' and the 'mentioned business', such as using the Vue framework)
4. Keep It Simple (KISS)

## Challenges I faced

1. Time: Because the challenge is considered easy and simple with different functionalities, so I had to complete it in a short time.

2. UI: Arrange the layout as required based on different screens and responsiveness.

- Grid Layout:

3. Big Code: How to structure a lot of code with vanilla technologies and Implement a simple page test

4. Forced Use JS: I have been using TypeScript for a long time but because it is organized and makes many things easier but with these simple technologies the best was JavaScript.
